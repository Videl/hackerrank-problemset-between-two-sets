Hacker Rank Problem Set "Between Two Sets"

Extract from problem: 


Consider two sets of positive integers, A and B. We say that
a positive integer, x, is between sets A and B if the following conditions are satisfied:

  1. All elements in A are factors of x.
  2. x is a factor of all elements in B.
  
Given A and B, find and print the number of integers (i.e., possible x's) that are between the two sets.
